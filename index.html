    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16"><b>G</b>iotto's <b>V</b>ices and <b>V</b>irtues </h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Virtues and Vices are <b>opposite moral values and qualities</b> of each other. A person can be described as virtuous, if s/he behaves as good as possible, always keeping in mind both the good motives and the good ends of her/his actions and performances.  On the other hand, a vicious person fails to attain good. Her/his motives are bad, and s/he behaves in order to harm others, being pleased by others' failures. Moral virtues and vices are traits of character, parts of our <b>innate</b> background therefore, they cannot be learned, they are natural senses.
</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">In the <b>Scrovegni Chapel</b>, <b>Giotto</b> paints the human virtues and vices, using the <b>fresco technique</b>, as part of the Holy Story of Salvation. These are needed to explicitly show which behaviors prepare the devoted person for arrival into Heaven or entry into Hell. Giotto adequately connects the <b>fourteen frescoes</b> with the <b>Last Judgment</b> painting, which is seen on the counter facade. At the bottom right of the Last Judgment the righteous are flying towards Heaven, whereas on the opposite side, the sinful are being tortured in Hell. Following this schema, the virtues are displayed on the right wall and the vices mirror them on the left wall. Moreover, their direction is often pointing towards the Judgment scene, so that the pious visitor can immediately connect them with the celestial destiny.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
The positioning of these fourteen frescoes was strategically planned by Giotto. In order to ensure the paintings properly <b>educated the viewers</b>, Giotto positioned them in the <b>lowest register at eye level</b>. These images were made by grisaille, meaning the artist primarily used a monochromatic color to obtain the illusion of a sculpture-like statue. In order to further highlight the centrality of virtues and vices in human character and destiny, Giotto used <b>naturalism</b> to depict each figure, as well as many techniques and symbols to make them come to life. Each figure is inserted in a frame painted in order to resemble marble. For these, Giotto used the <b>secco su fresco (dry on fresh) technique</b>, which has been used since the ancient Roman period to represent marble. This technique consists of applying a fresh oily material to the designated surface, which was then polished with a hot iron in order to obtain the shiny marble effect.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
      For the decoration of the chapel, Giotto started from the seven virtues: Hope, Charity, Faith, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude and Prudence, of which he learned from the works of the catholic philosopher Tommaso d'Aquino (Thomas Aquinas). Although, he did not completely follow the traditional seven deadly vices. He made the peculiar decision of depicting  the exact opposite of his virtues, to clearly and directly create <b>seven contrasting pairs</b>. Three of the vices that we find on the walls of the Cappella degli Scrovegni are the deadly ones: Despair, Envy and Ire. The other typical four, Pride, Avarice, Lust, and Gluttony have instead been replaced by Idolatry, Injustice, Inconstancy and Foolishness. His guide, Aquinas, had not written a list of seven unequivocal sins, so he chose to distance himself from the contemporary conception, as Dante did, and chose to stay with the model of opposites. In particular, the absence of Avarice is interesting to note. Giotto did not include this vice due to personal reasons; his customer’s father, Rinaldo degli Scrovegni, was an usurer and Dante, in his Divine Comedy, destined Rinaldo to a life in Hell. To redeem the family name, Rinaldo’s son Enrico commissioned Giotto, the most famous artist of the time, to create this masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">The naturalism and <b>deep psychological insight</b> present in these works make Giotto one of the most important contributors to the iconography of virtues and vices.

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:2px">
  Legends and facts are impossible to distinguish when speaking about Giotto’s life. Starting from his name, which is unknown to this day, Giotto could be the shorter version of another name, perhaps “Biagiotto”, “Ambrogiotto”, “Angelotto”, or even “Ruggerotto”.
He was the son of a famous farmer, <b>Bondone</b>. They lived in the countryside close to the city of <b>Florence</b>, more precisely in the city called Colle di Vespignano. Giotto grew up a shepherd boy and when he was out with his sheep, he passed time by drawing animals on rocks. One day <b>Cimabue</b>, a famous Florentine painter, passed by and noticed how real and natural the boy’s drawings looked. The wise painter decided to bring Giotto with him as an <b>apprentice</b>. While there is a lack of evidence that the wunderkind attended the bottega of the second most renowned artist of 14th century Florence, many anecdotes hint to this theory, specifically one by <b>Giorgio Vasari</b>, the artist and historian who wrote the Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, which captured the time from Cimabue and ended with Vasari himself. Nonetheless, the two artists can be related because of their vastly similar styles. Cimabue attempted to renovate the stylized forms of <b>medieval art</b> by <b>incorporating dramatic tension and naturalism</b>. In addition, some experts recognize Giotto’s hands in some of the master’s artworks.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
  The first artworks that can be attributed to Giotto are the Crucifix in the <b>church of Santa Maria Novella</b>, and the frescoes of the great double <b>church of St. Francis in Assisi</b>. Both of these masterpieces were realized in the last years of the 13th century and are outstanding examples of expressivity and humanity. Giotto received help in the production of these works from several assistants. A multitude of hands are recognizable, especially in Assisi’s frescoes, which has led some experts to believe that Giotto was not involved in those works. However, many reliable sources suspect these to be Giotto’s early masterpieces because of the many common features recognized in the frescoes in Assisi and those in Padova.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
At the beginning of the 14th century, Giotto arrived in <b>Padova</b>, which at the time was an independent Comune ruled by the Carrarese family. He worked in the Basilica of St. Anthony and in the Palazzo della Ragione, the city’s medieval town hall and marketplace. Eventually, he was commissioned by the wealthy Scrovegni family to paint their private Chapel. The <b>Scrovegni Chapel</b> is considered <b>Giotto’s absolute masterpiece</b>. There is no doubt that Giotto realized each fresco within the chapel and he received very little help from apprentices.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
  Giotto moved around many Italian Comuni. After his Paduan period, he worked in Rimini, Assisi, Florence, Rome and Naples. Of high importance are his Florentine artworks. The frescoes of the Cappella Bardi in the Church of Santa Croce are considered the summa of his artistic career. Although, his <b>iconic fresco technique</b> was not used; he resorted to using the dry technique due to time constraints. This unfortunately led to the quicker deterioration of these paintings. Finally, it is important to mention that Giotto was not just a painter, but also a <b>360 degree artist.</b> In 1334 Giotto was bestowed the title, Master of the Works of the Florence Cathedral, thus, he designed and constructed the bell tower.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
  Giotto died in Florence in 1337, however his legacy continued throughout the next centuries. He helped define the figure of a true artist as we know it today. After Giotto, artists were no longer labeled as mere artisans, but developed as a class of their own.
</p>

    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">Where are these frescoes located?</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        In 1300, the rich <b>banker Enrico Scrovegni</b> purchased a plot of land in Padova where a Roman arena once stood. He envisioned his palace to be there, along with a <b>small chapel</b>.
In 1303, Scrovegni commissioned Giotto to decorate the chapel, which would serve as both a <b>private church</b> for his family and as a <b>funerary monument</b> for him and his wife. This church has taken various names; the most famous one is Scrovegni Chapel. A second name is the <b>Arena Chapel</b> because of the land’s ties to the old Roman amphitheater. Moreover, it is also known as the Chapel of Our Lady of Charity, for Scrovegni's devotion to the Virgin Mary. This specific worship also influenced Giotto’s work and the iconography of the entire frescoes’ cycle.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
Between <b>1303</b> and the beginning of <b>1305</b>, Giotto painted all of the chapel walls and divided them into four registers of frescoes. For the iconographic program, the painter chose to depict the Story of Salvation, following the theory presented by Jacopo da Varazze in the <b>Legenda Aurea</b> (Golden Legend). On the upper register of the sidewalls, the Life of Joachim and Anna, and the Life of the Virgin are depicted. The Life of Christ is on the second and third registers; whereas in the last one, Giotto painted the seven virtues and seven vices.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
The most important fresco is on the <b>counter facade</b>. There, Giotto depicted the <b>Last Judgment</b>, which is the focus of the entire Chapel’s narration.  In the middle of this populated scene, there is Christ in Majesty. He is positioned inside the traditional iridescent mandorla, held by angels. Both his hands are pointing at the two groups of people beneath him. On His right, are the blessed Elects, who are flying towards Heaven. On His left, there is a cruel representation of medieval Hell. In here, Damned people are being tortured by Satan, together with his diabolic helpers. On the ground, Enrico Scrovegni is kneeing. He is offering this Chapel to the Three Maries, hoping to redeem himself and his family from their past sins.
On March 25th, 1305 the Scrovegni Chapel was consecrated and immediately, it became one of the most significant milestones in the <b>development of western art</b>. Giotto’s peers were highly impressed and influenced by his ability to represent the feelings of his protagonists. Now, people depicted in artwork would no longer be hieratic or solemn figures. They would become living human beings, who could communicate their emotions in a very strong way.
</p>

    <h4 class="w3-padding-16">What is a fresco?</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
      A Fresco painting is a technique with <b>water-based pigments on wet plaster</b> that is <b>applied to the walls</b>. In doing so, the colors can dry directly on the surface. Since the era of Neanderthals, people have chosen wall paintings as one of their main ways of artistic expression. From the Minoan to the ancient Egyptians, from the Greeks to the Romans, all of the ancient populations produced wall paintings. These are commonly called frescoes, however they are completely different from how we identify frescos today.
      While painting the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, and later on the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova, <b>Giotto revolutionized the wall paintings</b> and invented a new technique in the process. Before Giotto, painters would divide the walls into broad zones, which were as wide as the wall and as tall as the painter. In these broad areas, only the first, basic passages and lines were painted while the plaster was still wet. The rest of the paintings, which took many days to complete, were painted on the dry wall.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
  Giotto introduced <b>two important changes</b> of this technique: the usage of the <b>preparatory drawings</b> and the <b>last coat of plaster applied in smaller sections day by day</b>.
  The preparatory drawings are called sinopia. These drawings were made on the third coat of plaster. The painter would trace the outline of his figures to have a reference during the most important part of their work. Moreover, Giotto divided the sinopia into smaller sections called giornate, which means “a day of work”. He would cover only the limited section that he knew he would be able to paint each time with a thin fourth coat of plaster, called intonaco. Therefore, the painter was able to paint on wet plaster during the entire process. Looking closer at the frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel, it is possible to distinguish some of the giornate, especially in the sky areas.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" style="margin-top:1px">
This new technique used by Giotto caused the <b>birth of fresco as the world knows it today</b>. In Italian, fresco translates to “while wet” and the history of fresco in this sense can be traced back not to the ancient cave drawings, but to Giotto's works.

    <p>
      This project aims at analyzing important pieces of art history, fundamental for​​ the <b>world's cultural heritage</b> as Giotto contributed to the ultimate definition of the fresco's technique in the Cappella degli Scrovegni.
      <br/>In particular, the theme of the project is related to the Vices and Virtues depicted in the base layer of the chapel. These feagures were chosen because when people think about Cappella degli Scrovegni, they don’t immediately think about them. It is important to <b>raise awareness and provoke conversation</b> about them.
