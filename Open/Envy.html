    <div style="margin:2em"> 
        <h1 border-top:2em>Envy </h1>
        <p style="margin-top:-1"> Giotto’s visualization of Envy is that of an old lady, who has a snake coming out of her mouth and biting her own eyes. Envious people tend to damn others, but this negative attitude turns against them. Following the epistemology of the word invidia (in ‘into’ + vedere ‘to see’) which literally means ‘regard maliciously’, this vice is consumed by her blinding preoccupation. This female figure is in fact a demon, as shown by the horns coming out of her bonnet. In addition to this, her ears are larger than normal, symbolizing the animal-like attitude of people who sin with envy. She is tightly holding a money bag with her left hand, alluding to the greed that characterizes envious people. The flames that are burning this figure’s feet are the allegory for both the constant burning desire of possessing what belongs to others, and for Hell. Blinded by the snake, this elder woman is groping her way towards the eternal infernal flames. </p>
