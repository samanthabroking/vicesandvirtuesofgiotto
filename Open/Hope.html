        <p style="margin-top:-1">Giotto depicts Hope as a winged female figure, taking flight towards the upper right corner of the rectangle where the figure is inserted. She is reaching towards a crown, handed to her by a little angel, of whom only the chest is visible. The crown is the symbol of supernatural life with the reward for those who never gave up and patiently waited for a glorious life in the Kingdom of Heaven. The wings symbolize the elevation of the soul, and the ability of hopeful people to see beyond the monotony of every-day life. This is the last figure painted on the right side wall before the Last Judgment, and this woman is in profile, flying and ready to get together with the righteous people who are finally reaching Heaven.</p>
