        <h1 border-top:2em>Foolishness </h1>
        <p style="margin-top:-1">The most unique and humorous figure that Giotto realized in the Chapel is the one representing Foolishness. It is a man wearing jester’s clothes with a plum crown on his head. Two spheres hang from his braided belt are symbols of the lack of self-control that characterizes idiotic people. The thick club that he is holding symbolizes the potential danger to those who are not educated with God’s teaching. He is not able to understand the Holy message because he is using only his animal spirit to judge them. On the contrary, the religious and rational man can understand God’s word. Consequently, he is able to fairly judge everything, without having to be judged by anyone. </p>
