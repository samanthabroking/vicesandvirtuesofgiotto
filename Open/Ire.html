        <p style="margin-top:-1">An old, corrupted magistrate stands for Injustice, the central vice in Giotto’s representation. He is kept prisoner inside a collapsing palace, which symbolizes the consequences of his misbehavior. The bushes in front of him symbolize the limitations and restrictions forced upon those he wrongly condemned. The figure holds a sword in his left hand, the symbol for punishment. However, he cannot use it anymore because he is unable to move. The grappling hook on the other hand symbolizes the immoral wish of unjust people to obtain what they do not deserve. At the bottom of the frieze, there are scenes of people acting inadequately, as when Injustice is in power and does not care about people’s rights and duties.</p>
