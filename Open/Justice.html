        <p style="margin-top:-1">Giotto decides to dress Faith with a long, holed dress, a cape and a pointed hat. The fact that her clothing has some holes indicates that a good Christian should not focus on her/himself too much, specifically on physical appearance or her/his belongings. The pointed hat is actually a stylized miter, the typical episcopal headgear. Hanging from her belt there is a key with which she will be able to access the Kingdom of Heaven.  Faith holds some important Catholic symbols that are needed to declare her religious feelings. In her left hand she holds a scroll, which represents the Gospels, and in the other hand she holds a long stick with a cross on top. She is using the bottom of her stick to smash an idol. This is an allegory of the myths and fake goddesses that will never be able to replace God in the hearts of people. With her feet, Faith is stepping on some boards with arabesques. These allude to both Judaism and to the horoscope. This figure is looking right at the viewer, as if she is having a private and intense conversation with each person, reminding her/him that the belief of God is important and salvific. </p>
