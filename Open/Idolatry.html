        <h1 border-top:2em>Idolatry </h1>
        <p style="margin-top:-1">Idolatry is one of the few figures represented by a man. He is a soldier who wears a helmet. With his right hand he is holding an idol, which is gripping a noose that is around the soldierâ€™s neck. This is a symbol of slavery generated by the belief in fake myths. The rope is preventing the man from turning backwards towards the top left corner, where the figure of Truth appears. Truth is personified by a prophet, who uselessly holds and tries to read his scroll, a symbol of the Divine message. The bottom right corner displays a fire. This is the premonition of the flames of Hell, which will torture unfaithful people for eternity. </p>
