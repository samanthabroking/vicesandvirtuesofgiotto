# Vices and Virtues of Giotto 

This project was created by [Giada Tasinato](https://github.com/giadatasinato04?tab=repositories), [Rachele Alba](https://github.com/rachelealba96?tab=repositories) and [Samantha Broking](https://github.com/samanthabroking?tab=repositories) to showcase the skills acquired within the course, Modeling and Visualizing Textual Data. This master's class was held at Ca' Foscari and taught by professor Tiziana Mancinelli and professor Antonio Montefusco.

## About the Project
From the recommended theme of Vices and Virtues, we decided to focus our project on those depicted by Giotto which can be seen in the Cappella degli Scrovegni (PD). We started by building a concept map to help us visualize the structure we wanted for our project. After carefully considering multiple ontologies, we chose Wikidata becsause it best represented our ideas.

With the structure completed, we shifted our focus to finding the pictures. Due to a lack of high quality images and our close proximity to the chapel we decided to visit and take our own photos. With the help of our lab instructor, [Valerio Remediani](https://github.com/VRemediani), we attained the iiif links of the 14 images so we could implement them into OpenSeadragon and Mirador. 

At this point in the project, we divided tasks amongst the three of us: 
- Giada
  - All text descriptions 
  - Manifest 
  - OpenSeaDragon

- Rachele 
  - Website design with html 
  - iiif viewer 
  - Mirador 

- Samantha 
  - Concept map on Miro  
  - Foaf.ttl and RDF describing group members 
  - Edits to the text 
  - Manifest 

Once our tasks were all completed, we came back together and combined our material. Rachele proceded with pushing all the items in her repository, then Giada and Samantha pulled and pushed on to their own github repositories. Small edits have been made since to imporve the project. 

### Project Goals

This project aims to analyze the Vices and Virtues of Giotto due to their significance in art history. Giotto reformed the iconography of these moral qualities, which then became the main way to depict them. The frescos of the Cappella degli Scrovegni were so fundamental that the church was deemed a UNESCO site in 2021; although, the Vices and Virtues remain relatively unknown to the public. Therefore, we hope to raise awareness and provoke conversation about these essential pieces of art.

## Visualization 

Below are the three visualization methods that we implemented in our website. 

### Open Folder 

Here you can find the OpenSeadragon code for each Vice and Virtue. The 14 images come with a description and the following metadata: 
- Artist 
- Dating 
- Medium 
- Dimension 
- Virtue/Vice Number 
- Opposite Virtue/Vice 
- Latin Inscription 
- Picture License 

### Mirador 

All the 14 images are present in the Mirador Viewer, which is connected with the manifest. 

### Viewer 

To better visualize each Virtue and Vice couple, we implemented the iiif viewer. 

## Img Folder 

This folder contains all of the images present on the website. 

## Manifest 

The manifest contains 14 canvases with all the images and general information.

## Licensing 

All the materials in this project are free to use. No restrictions :)
